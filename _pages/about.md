I am a graduate student in the Graduate School of Artificial Intelligence integrated M.S. & Ph.D. program at [POSTECH](https://www.postech.ac.kr). I am a member of the [Computer Vision Lab](http://cvlab.postech.ac.kr/lab/) at POSTECH, advised by Prof. [Minsu Cho](http://cvlab.postech.ac.kr/~mcho/). 
Previously, I completed my B.S. in Convergence IT Engineering at POSTECH.\
\
My research interests lie in computer vision and deep learning. 
Especially, I'm interested in understanding temporal and semantic relations of actions.
I've worked on long-term action anticipation.
If you are interested in my research projects, please feel free to contact me by clicking one of the icons below.
